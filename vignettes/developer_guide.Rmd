This document gives technical details on the implementation of the `{ino}` package.

## Objects

The `{ino}` package uses an object-oriented framework based on the `{R6}` package [@Chang:2021]. 

### `Nop` object

A `Nop` object is an `R6` object. It is the only object that a user of `{ino}` will interact with. The code is in the `R/nop.R` file. The purpose of this object is to

- contain everything that defines the numerical optimization problem,

- provide methods for evaluating and optimizing the target function,

- ...

### `Runs` object

A `Runs` object is an `R6` object. It is contained inside a `Nop` object. The code is in the `R/runs.R` file. The purpose of this object is 

- contain the results of optimization runs,

- provide methods for summarizing, extracting, and filtering the results,

- ...

### `S3` methods

The `R/s3.R` file implements `S3` methods for convenience.

## Helper and check functions

The `R/helper.R` file implements helper functions, `R/checks.R` implements check functions.

## Demos

The `R/demo.R` file documents demonstrations of the `{ino}` package, `R/functions.R` implements functions for demonstrations.
