* Please don't use "T" or "F" as vector names.

Reply: We changed the variable name 'T' to 'Tp'.

* Uses the superseded package: 'doSNOW'. You cannot switch to doParallel? 

Reply: We use 'doSNOW' because we want to print computation progress via the 'progress' package in a parallelized for-loop. There seems to be no simple alternative at the moment, including 'doParallel'.

* Is there some reference about the method you can add in the Description field in the form Authors (year) <doi:10.....> or <arXiv:.....>? 

Reply: Unfortunately, there is no reference yet.
