* Unfortunately, we currently cannot provide any references.

* We have examples for unexported functions of our package. These functions are generally not used by the user of our package, so we prefer not to export them. However, we still want to provide the examples for documentation and to enable automatic testing.

* We replaced the two \dontrun{} by \donttest{}.
